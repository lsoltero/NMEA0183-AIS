= NMEA2000 -> SeaSmart/NMEA0183 WiFi converter =

 NMEA0183/NMEA2000 library. NMEA2000 -> NMEA0183

   Reads messages from NMEA2000 and converts them to SeaSmart
   format and some also to NMEA0183 format and acts as server
   on WiFi network.

   The example is designed for sending N2k data to WiFi in NMEA0183 + AIS
   and SeaSmart format. You can use this with OpenCPN and various
   mobile app, like iSailor, which can connect to TCP server and read NMEA0183 + AIS.

   Capable of Output Text or Actisense format on Serial (USB)

   Example has been tested on ESP32.

   Currently you need to define you WiFi settings on the beginning
   of main.cpp

 To use this example you need install also:

   - NMEA2000 library

   - NMEA0183 library

   - Related CAN libraries.

   - ESP32 environment installed

   - NMEA0183-AIS
